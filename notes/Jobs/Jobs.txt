Containers:

Containers can contain items. A sword on the ground is a container with a single item.
A storage container is a container
A Building under construction is a container
Basically anything requiring people to pick up stuff and bring it is a container

Stores that have empty storage should put out a call to the job manager to say:
 - Hey, I need resources
 
Buildings under construction can also work like this, except they have a higher priority 
than regular stores.


How to deal with multiple stores that both have space?
